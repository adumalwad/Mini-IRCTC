# Mini-IRCTC
# CS315 DBMS Project IIT Kanpur (IITK)

Hello guys !!! This project is an online railway ticket booking platform same as IRCTC. This project also consisted of a mailing feature (user get mail for booking/cancelling a ticket, email verification, tatkal booking) which helped me get extra marks (96 out of 100). I have deleted all bookings and user details; you need to add them. 

**Front-end:** HTML, JavaScript,PHP, Bootstrap3,CSS \
**Backend:** MySQL 

To run this project properly on your system, you need to do the following steps:

1)Step 1: Install XAMPP.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8N4FEQWyY&t=526s&ab_channel=edureka%21](url) \
2)Step 2: Extract the .zip file and add the folder inside extracted folder to " C:\xampp\htdocs "\
3)Step 3: Change the port number in "connect_database.php" according to your MySQL port number.\
4)Step 4: To get all mailing features, use this link [https://www.codingnepalweb.com/configure-xampp-to-send-mail-from-localhost/](URL) \
5)step 5: Start XAMPP (apache and MySQL).\
6)step 6: Run [http://localhost/railway](URL) on your browser, and you are ready to use :)


**Remember:**
 1) **admin login:** username->cs315 password->cs15. (check .sql file for admin username and password)
 2) Before booking ticket, schedule train on that date.
 3) User can  not login without mail verification.
 4) Check foreign keys and primary key before delating particular table's data.
