# Mini-IRCTC
# CS315 DBMS Project IIT Kanpur (IITK)

Hello guys !!! This project is an online railway ticket booking platform similar to IRCTC. This project also consisted of a mailing feature (users get mail for booking/cancelling a ticket, email verification, and tatkal booking) which helped me get extra marks (96 out of 100). I have deleted all bookings and user details; you need to add them. 

**Front-end:** HTML, JavaScript,PHP, Bootstrap3,CSS \
**Backend:** MySQL 

To run this project properly on your system, you need to do the following steps:

1)Step 1: Install XAMPP.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8N4FEQWyY&t=526s&ab_channel=edureka%21](url) \
2)Step 2: Extract the .zip file and add the folder inside extracted folder to " C:\xampp\htdocs "\
3)Step 3: Change the port number in "connect_database.php" according to your MySQL port number.\
4)Step 4: To get all mailing features, use this link [https://www.codingnepalweb.com/configure-xampp-to-send-mail-from-localhost/](URL) \
5)step 5: Start XAMPP (apache and MySQL).\
6)step 6: Run [http://localhost/railway](URL) on your browser, and you are ready to use :)


**Remember:**
 1) **admin login:** username->cs315 password->cs315. (check the .sql file for the admin username and password)
 2) Before booking a ticket, schedule a train on that date.
 3) User can not log in without mail verification.
 4) Check foreign and primary keys before deleting a particular table's data.
 5) Script folder does not have any use. All codes in this folder are already present required files.
